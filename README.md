*Award-winning software for efficient LiDAR compression*

Open-source compression library for compressing LAS to LAZ.
LASzip is completely lossless: It compresses bulky LAS files into compact LAZ files that are only 7-20% of the original size, while accurately preserving every single bit. Likewise, LAZ files can be decompressed into a bitwise identical LAS file. LASzip allows compressed LAZ files to be treated like standard LAS files. They can be loaded directly from the compressed form into an application without first decompressing them to a disk.
